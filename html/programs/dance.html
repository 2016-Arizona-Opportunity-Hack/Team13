        Now more than ever our young people are in need of creative outlets for communication and self-exploration. The SSPF dance team is committed to providing a free dance program for students of the Chandler Unified School District. As part of the Si Se Puede Foundation, we strive to teach children the importance of teamwork, dedication, respect, and kindness through the art of dance. Our number one priority is to make sure that every child who participates in this program feels part of a safe community where they are able to be themselves.

        Our dance program offers many forms of dance and including: baile folklorico, country western, big band and rock n' roll.
