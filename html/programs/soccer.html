        Si Se Puede Foundation's Recreational Soccer is at no cost to the community and is the cornerstone of Si Se Puede Foundation's Youth sports program. Since 1998, 1000's of children and youth have come through our doors in the hopes of becoming the next professional soccer superstar. This is the place where children, youth and parents begin their soccer education as players, coaches, referees, committee members and soccer team moms.

        Soccer practices begin September 14, 2015. Your soccer coach will be making calls to parents. We will be serving 1,400 children this year.
