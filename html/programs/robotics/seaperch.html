        Si Se Puede Foundation is embracing the SeaPerch robotics program to expose our children to the engineering principles of underwater Vehicles. This innovative program helps our kids learn about underwater vehicles through building an underwater craft and then piloting it through an obstacle course plus other challenges.
        </br>
        </br>
        We will be holding its First Annual Regional Competition on March 5, 2016 at the Chandler High School Aquatics Center and located at 350 North Arizona Avenue, Chandler, AZ 85225. The competition is open to all Arizona Teams interested in participating in this groundbreaking underwater robotics event. The winners in each division will move on to the international competition held in Boston, Massachusetts in May 2016. Teams of students will compete in a variety of timed contests as well as present their designs to a panel of judges.
        </br>

    <h3>What is SeaPearch and where does it derive its name?</h3>
    <p>
        SeaPerch is an innovative underwater robotics program that equips teachers and students with the resources they need to build an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out-of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit comprised of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme. The SeaPerch Program provides students with the opportunity to learn about robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.
        </br>
        </br>
        Throughout the project, students will learn engineering concepts, problem solving, teamwork, and technical applications. Building a SeaPerch ROV teaches basic skills in ship and submarine design and encourages students to explore naval architecture and marine and ocean engineering principles. It also teaches basic science and engineering concepts and tool safety and technical procedures. Students learn important engineering and design skills and are exposed to all the exciting careers that are possible in naval architecture and naval, ocean, and marine engineering.
        </br>
        </br>  
        The name SeaPerch came from the USS Perch, a highly decorated World War II U.S. submarine.

        This competition is open to elementary, Jr. high and high school students. Each SeaPerch kit can be purchased for less than $200 and there are numerous on-line resources to help educators and mentors guide the students through the process.

        </br>
        </br>
        The competition is limited to the first 30 teams that respond. The cost to each team will be $50.00 and which will go towards awards. Let us know if you are interested in participating in this event and we will send you an application. Together we can build a strong regional.
