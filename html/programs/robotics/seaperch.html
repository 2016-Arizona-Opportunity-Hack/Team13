    <p>
        Si Se Puede Foundation is embracing the SeaPerch robotics program to expose our children to the engineering principles of underwater Vehicles. This innovative program helps our kids learn about underwater vehicles through building an underwater craft and then piloting it through an obstacle course plus other challenges.
