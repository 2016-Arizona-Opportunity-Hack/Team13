	<h4>History</h4>
	</br>
	</br>
	Si Se Puede Foundation (SSPF) was founded by <a href="">Alberto L. Esparza</a> in 1993, and became incorporated as a 501(c) 3, non-profit organization in 1998. The foundation is a prevention and advocacy organization that encourages its participants to be stakeholders in their community. The organization’s three main service components include educational programming, community activities & amp; advocacy, and recreational activities for youth. The organization focuses on school and community risk factors that are barriers to educational achievement including, delinquency, gang affiliation, and family/school/community detachment.

	The foundation primarily serves low-income, predominately minority communities throughout the Cities of Chandler and Phoenix. The students who participate in its programs are children and young adults between the ages of 6 to 18, who attend Title 1 schools and reside in at-risk neighborhoods within the Cities of Chandler and Phoenix. SSPF values diversity and makes all its programs available to all residents in the communities it serves.

	Our strong partnerships with City of Chandler, Chandler Unified School District, Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University, Intel, StateFarm Foundation, and Maricopa County Attorney’s Office has allowed SSPF to reach out to the local community to improve academic performance, generate excitement for science and technology, promote service through tutoring, provide opportunities for mentoring to students at all levels and recruit 60 girls to participate in our robotics program.
