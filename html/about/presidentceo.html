	<h3>Alberto L. Esparza</h3>
	<h4>President & CEO</h4>
	Alberto founded Si Se Puede Foundation in 1993. He is a native of Arizona and could see as a young adult the high dropout rate of minority students. As, he too, fought to continue his education and obtain a college degree; it became apparent that his focus was in the area of social services. Alberto earned a Bachelor's Degree from Arizona State University and obtained his Master's Degree from Northern Arizona University. His efforts teaching young people the importance of education is on-going as he develops the next generation of community leaders. Alberto has served on several volunteer boards and commissions, including the Phoenix Human Relations Commission (HRC) and as co-founder of the City of Phoenix national award-winning cultural diversity program, "We're all on the Same Team." While serving on the HRC, he served as ambassador for cultural diversity by promoting opportunities for positive exchange among diverse groups through community outreach, education and cultural diversity awareness.
	</br>
	</br>
	Over the last twenty-years, Alberto has guided the foundation in becoming a bridge builder and leader in providing community programs that improve the quality of life and strengthen communities, families and youth in the Phoenix East Valley. Alberto is highly visible in low-income communities within the East Valley, listening to the needs of the residents and providing programs that empower children and families to enrich their lives by participating in programs such as STEM/Robotics, Scholars Program and other programs offered by Si Se Puede.
